		<p>Hi there! My name is Minnie, currently a senior pursuing a dual degree in the School of Information
			and the Ross Business School at the University of Michigan. I'm creating this site as part of SI 339:
			Web Design, Development, and Accessibility. I'm in my final semester here at Michigan, and one of the things I
			already know I'll miss the most is my family's cooking.
		</p>

		<!-- Make sure your anchor tags have a link (href) and a clickable component -->
		<p>Growing up, food was a vital and central part of my family's culture and values. For some background, my family is
			made up of me, my mom, my dad, and my younger brother. Our hometown is Tianjin, China, a place known for some
			delectable dishes. We have a lot of family traditions revolving around food. For example, we don't start our meals
			until everyone is at the dinner table. My mom is a stay-at-home mom, who sacrificed so much to become the primary
			caregiver for me and my brother. She's also an insanely incredible chef who makes most of our meals.
			Because of this, I've developed a natural mindset that <b>cooking is one of the purest forms of service,
			love, and giving that there is.</b>
		<br>
		<br>
			As such, I think it's about time that I learned how to cook, as I am personally unable to cook much at all
			(my mom calls me her sous chef, which basically means I just do what she tells me to do and make her check
			everything to ensure I'm doing it right, so somehow I still can't cook anything without her guidance).
			I want to learn as many of my family's recipes as possible before I leave for Chicago later this year.
			That starts with documenting those recipes, which I'll be doing on this site!
			Welcome to the process.
		</p>
